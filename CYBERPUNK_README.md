## 🤔 Which Design Should You Use?

**Use Cyberpunk Version When:**
- Targeting crypto/web3 clients ✅
- Want to stand out dramatically ✅
- Comfortable with edgy branding ✅
- Audience is tech-savvy ✅

**Use Clean Version When:**
- Targeting corporate clients
- Conservative industries
- Older demographic
- Want "safe" professional look

**My recommendation:** Use the cyberpunk one. It's WAY more memorable and actually matches what you're building (autonomous AI agents). Plus crypto/trading clients will LOVE it.
